## FAQ
 1. **Is Bitvise affiliated with PuTTY?**
	 *Bitvise* is **not affiliated** with *PuTTY*. We develop our SSH Server for **Windows**, which is compatible with *PuTTY*. Many *PuTTY* users are therefore our users as well. From time to time, they need to find the [PuTTY download link](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

	We also provide an **SSH Client for Windows** which is not a version of *PuTTY*, but is **free** and **dedicatedly maintained**. Many *PuTTY* users like our SSH Client as well.
 3. **How did Bitvise acquire this domain?**
*Bitvise* was not the original registrant of putty.org. We purchased it from a previous owner who used it in ways unrelated to software. We thought it useful to repurpose it the way you see.

The precise licence text, as given in the About box and in the file LICENCE in the source distribution, is as follows:

In particular, anybody (even companies) can use PuTTY without restriction (even for commercial purposes) and owe nothing to us, or to anybody else. Also, apart from having to maintain the copyright notice and the licence text in derivative products, anybody (even companies) can adapt the PuTTY source code into their own programs and products (even commercial products) and owe nothing to us or anybody else. And, of course, there is no warranty and if PuTTY causes you damage you're on your own, so don't use it if you're unhappy with that.

In particular, note that the MIT licence **is compatible with the GNU GPL**. So if you want to incorporate PuTTY or pieces of PuTTY into a GPL program, there's no problem with that.
